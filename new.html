        <p> The early history of life on earth may have been characterized by coevolution of microbial metabolism and atmospheric composition. Metabolic developments affected the composition of the atmosphere, and the resulting changes in the atmosphere stimulated the evolution of new metabolic capabilities. The first organisms eked out an existence by deriving energy from the fermentation of organic compounds abiotically synthesized. The abiotic source was meager, however, <br>and when autotrophy arose, life was freed from its dependence on abiotic synthesis. The expanded level of biological activity made possible by autotrophy resulted in an increased rate of burial of reduced organic matter in sea floor sediments. The resultant drain on the concentration of electron donors in the biosphere caused a decline in the hydrogen content of the atmosphere. Biological productivity was limited by the supply of reduced compounds. This paper explores the biogeochemical circulation of electron donors in the primitive anaerobic ocean, concluding that their shortage was so critical as to provide strong selective pressure for the evolution of algal photosynthesis.
